'''#CRISP-ML(Q)
Business Problem: CocaCola management is reactive in understanding the sales patterns.
They are missing a chance to proactively take actions to meet their sales targets.

Business Objective: Maximize Revenue
Business Constraints: Minimize the gut feel based decisions

Success Criteria: 
    Business: Increase the revenue by at least 20%
    ML: Achieve an accuracy of at least 85%
    Economic: Achieve an increase in revenue by at least $200K

Data Understanding:
    Quaterly sales data from Q1 '86 until Q2 '96. In total we have 42 quarters of data. 
    We have two columns
    Column 1: Quarter
    Column 2: Sales (Target / Output) '''
